---

## Requirement 1
# 🔑 Key Concepts & Vocabulary

--

## The Language of AI

Before we go further, let's define the terms:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — computer systems that perform tasks that normally require human intelligence
- **Machine Learning (ML)** — a type of AI where systems learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed
- **Narrow AI** — AI designed to do one specific task (most AI today)
- **General AI** — hypothetical AI that can do *any* intellectual task a human can
- **Superintelligent AI** — hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in every area

Note: Ask scouts which of these they think exists today. Only narrow AI is real and widely deployed. General AI and superintelligent AI remain theoretical.

--

## More Key Terms

- **Automation** — using technology to perform repetitive tasks without human intervention
- **AI Agents** — AI systems that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals
- **Bots** — automated programs that perform tasks over the internet
- **Digital Workers** — AI or software systems that handle business processes previously done by humans

Note: The distinction between automation and AI is important — automation follows fixed rules; AI learns and adapts.

--

## Data and Workflow Terms (1/2)

- **Data** — raw facts and figures (numbers, text, images, audio) — the fuel that powers AI
- **Database** — organized collection of structured data
- **Variables** — named storage locations that hold data values
- **Basic Programming** — instructions written in code that tell a computer what to do

Note: These are the foundational building blocks — data is what AI learns from, programming is how you direct it.

--

## Data and Workflow Terms (2/2)

- **Tasks** — individual units of work a system performs
- **Triggers** — events or conditions that cause a task to start
- **Workflows** — sequences of tasks that accomplish a larger goal
- **Prompt Engineering** — the skill of writing effective instructions for AI systems

Note: The data → trigger → workflow → task chain is how almost all automation and AI systems are structured.

--

## Quick Check

**Match the term to the example:**

| Example | Term |
|---------|------|
| Netflix recommends a show based on your history | Machine Learning |
| Siri answers any question you ask | Narrow AI |
| A chatbot that handles customer service tickets | AI Agent / Bot |
| A system that emails you when a package ships | Trigger + Workflow |
| Your favorite songs — organized | Database |

Note: Go through these quickly as a verbal check. Don't dwell — the rest of the session will reinforce these concepts in context.

---

*Scout connection: Environmental Science merit badge*

Note: Follow-up: 1. What factors influence its decisions? 2. How does it save water compared to the timer version? 3. What sensors does it use?

--

## Round 12

# Vending Machine

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 12 — Answer

# Vending Machine

## NOT AI

Classic **input → fixed output**. Press B3, get chips. It doesn't learn your preferences, suggest alternatives, or adapt to anything.

> Unless it's a modern vending machine with facial recognition and personalized recommendations — then it IS AI!

---

## Requirement 4
# ⚖️ Ethics in AI

--

## 4a — Ethical Concerns: Bias & Privacy

**🎯 Bias**
- AI learns from data — if the data is biased, the AI is biased
- Example: facial recognition that works worse for darker skin tones
- Why it happens: training data didn't represent everyone equally

**🔒 Privacy**
- AI systems collect and analyze enormous amounts of personal data
- Who owns that data? Who can access it? How long is it kept?
- Example: smart speakers always "listening" for wake words

Note: These are not abstract concerns — they affect real people. Recommended videos from Digital Resources guide: "Ethics & AI: Equal Access and Algorithmic Bias", "How Will AI Change the World?", "How AI Uses Our Drinking Water", "How Much Electricity Will AI Need?"

--

## 4a — Ethical Concerns: AI Decision-Making

**🤖 AI Decision-Making**
- When AI makes decisions about jobs, loans, parole, medical care — who is accountable?
- Can you appeal a decision made by an algorithm?
- Should there always be a human in the loop for high-stakes decisions?

> As AI gets more powerful, these questions become more urgent — not less.

--

## 4b — "What Would You Do?"

**5 rounds** with your counselor.

- Counselor reads the scenario
- You discuss: what would YOU do — and why?
- Then advance to see key tensions and guiding questions

> There are no right answers. Thoughtful reasoning is the goal.

Note: Encourage scouts to justify their positions. Push back gently. The point is ethical reasoning practice, not agreement. Recommended video: "10 Ethical Dilemmas AI Brings to Society" (Digital Resources guide).

--

## Round 1

# The Resume Screener

An AI reviewed your job application and rejected it — **before any human ever saw it.**

**What should happen?**

Note: Pause here. Let scouts discuss before advancing.

--

## Round 1 — Discussion

# The Resume Screener

- Should there always be a human reviewing AI decisions that affect people's lives?
- If the AI is wrong, who is accountable — the company? The developer? The AI itself?
- What if the AI was trained on biased historical data?

> **Key tension:** Efficiency vs. accountability.

--

## Round 2

# The Eagle Scout Report

A scout uses AI to write their entire Eagle Scout project report and submits it as their own work.

**Is this a problem?**

Note: Pause here. Let scouts discuss before advancing.

--

## Round 2 — Discussion

# The Eagle Scout Report

- Which points of the Scout Law apply? *(Trustworthy? Honest? Brave?)*
- What's the difference between using AI as a tool vs. letting AI do your work?
- Does it matter if the project itself was genuinely the scout's idea and effort?

> **Key tension:** Integrity vs. using available tools.

--

## Round 3

# The Medical Chatbot

A company's AI chatbot gives a customer incorrect medical advice. The customer follows it and is harmed.

**Who is responsible?**

Note: Pause here. Let scouts discuss before advancing.

--

## Round 3 — Discussion

# The Medical Chatbot

- The company that built it? The company that deployed it? The user who trusted it?
- Should AI be allowed to give medical advice at all?
- How should AI communicate its own uncertainty and limitations?

> **Key tension:** Innovation and access vs. safety and clear accountability.

--

## Round 4

# The Crime Predictor

An AI predicts a neighborhood has high crime risk. Police are assigned to patrol it more heavily — **before any crime occurs.**

**Is this fair?**

Note: Pause here. Let scouts discuss before advancing.

--

## Round 4 — Discussion

# The Crime Predictor

- If the AI was trained on historical arrest data, could it inherit past biases?
- Is predicting crime the same as preventing it — or is it punishing people for something they haven't done?
- What rights do people in that neighborhood have?

> **Key tension:** Public safety vs. civil rights and algorithmic fairness.

--

## Round 5

# The Surveillance System

Your school's AI monitoring software flags your messages as suspicious. You were just venting to a friend about a bad day.

**What are your rights?**

Note: Pause here. Let scouts discuss before advancing.

--

## Round 5 — Discussion

# The Surveillance System

- Does it matter whether this is a school device, personal phone, or public platform?
- Who sees the flagged messages? What happens next? Can you appeal?
- How do you balance student safety with privacy and the right to express yourself?

> **Key tension:** Safety and prevention vs. privacy and trust.

--

## 4c — Your Own Ethical Guidelines for AI

Develop **your own guidelines** for using AI responsibly.

**Think about:**
- When is it okay to use AI-generated content?
- What information should you never share with an AI?
- How should you verify AI-generated information?
- Who is responsible when AI makes a mistake?
- How should AI treat people differently from how it treats data?

> Write at least 3-5 personal guidelines you would actually follow.

Note: These guidelines are personal — scouts should write ones they believe in, not ones they think the counselor wants to hear.

--

## 4d — The Turing Test

**What is it?**

Proposed by mathematician **Alan Turing** in 1950.

A human judge has text conversations with:
- Another human
- A machine

If the judge **can't reliably tell which is which**, the machine passes the Turing Test.

**Does passing mean the machine is "intelligent"?**

> That's one of the deepest questions in computer science — and it's still debated.

Note: Some philosophers argue the Turing Test only measures the ability to imitate, not true understanding. Ask scouts: "Could ChatGPT pass the Turing Test?" Recommended videos: "The Turing Test: Can a Computer Pass for a Human?" and "AI Passes Turing Test? ChatGPT 4.5 Fools 73% of Humans" (Digital Resources guide).

---

## Requirement 5
# 🎭 Deepfakes

--

## 5a — What Is a Deepfake?

**Deepfake** — AI-generated media (video, audio, or images) that realistically depicts someone saying or doing something they never said or did.

**How it works:**
- AI analyzes thousands of images/videos of a real person
- It learns to map their facial movements, voice patterns, expressions
- It can then generate convincing fake video of that person

--

## 5a — How Deepfakes Affect Individuals

**How it can affect an individual:**
- 😰 Damage to reputation — fake videos can go viral
- 💔 Emotional harm — seeing yourself in fabricated scenarios
- 💸 Financial harm — fake audio used in scams ("grandparent scams")
- ❓ Trust erosion — people stop believing *any* video evidence

> The "grandparent scam" — AI mimicking a grandchild's voice to request money — is an active and growing threat.

Note: Show scouts a deepfake detection tool if possible. Recommended videos from Digital Resources guide: "Deepfakes", "How to Spot Fake AI Photos", "When AI Can Fake Reality, Who Can You Trust?"

--

## 5b — What to Do If You're Affected

**If you or someone you know is targeted by a deepfake:**

**Immediate steps:**
- Do NOT share or engage with the content — that spreads it further
- Screenshot and document evidence before it disappears
- Report it to the platform where it appears (most have deepfake policies)
- Tell a trusted adult immediately

**Escalation:**
- Report to school administration if it involves a classmate
- Contact local law enforcement — many states have deepfake laws
- The **Cyber Civil Rights Initiative** (cybercivilrights.org) provides resources

> In most states, creating non-consensual deepfake content is illegal.

Note: Emphasize that this is not a "just ignore it" situation. Deepfakes used to harm individuals — especially minors — are a serious legal matter.

---

## Requirement 6
# 🛠️ Developing AI Skills

--

## 6a — How AI Learns

<iframe class="yt-embed" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9OHn5ZF4Uo" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Note: Play this ~5min video before the technical discussion. It shows how recommendation algorithms learn from behavior — directly relevant to what follows.

--

## 6a — How AI Learns (and Its Limits)

**The AI learning process:**
1. Collect massive amounts of training data
2. Feed it through a model that adjusts based on errors
3. Repeat millions of times until the model performs well
4. Test on data it has never seen before

**Important limitations:**
- AI only knows what's in its training data — no common sense beyond that
- It can "hallucinate" — generate confident-sounding wrong answers
- It has a knowledge cutoff — it doesn't know about recent events
- It can't truly reason — it finds patterns, not understanding
- Biased training data produces biased outputs

Note: The hallucination point is critical. "AI said it" is not a reliable citation. Also recommended: "Explain Machine Learning to a Kid" and "How Does AI Learn?" (see Digital Resources guide).

--

## 6b — Five Methods to Communicate Effectively with AI

1. **Be specific** — vague questions get vague answers
2. **Provide context** — tell the AI who you are and what you're trying to accomplish
3. **Give examples** — show the format or style you want
4. **Iterate** — treat it like a conversation, not a one-shot query
5. **Verify outputs** — always check AI answers against reliable sources

Note: Run a live demo if possible — show a vague prompt vs. a specific prompt and compare the outputs.

--

## 6c — Why Prompt Engineering Matters

**Prompt Engineering** — the skill of writing clear, effective instructions for AI systems.

**Same question, very different results:**

| Weak Prompt | Strong Prompt |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Plan a campout" | "Plan a 3-day backpacking menu for 8 scouts. All meals must need no refrigeration. Include estimated calories per meal." |
| "Explain AI" | "Explain machine learning to a 14-year-old using an analogy involving sports" |
| "Help me tie a knot" | "I'm learning to tie a bowline. Walk me through each step, describing what the rope should look like at each stage." |

> As AI becomes more powerful, knowing how to direct it becomes more valuable.

Note: This is a genuinely marketable skill. Recommended videos: "Google's 9 Hour AI Prompt Engineering Course in 20 Minutes" and "How to Use ChatGPT Effectively (and Avoid Common Mistakes)" (Digital Resources guide).

--

## 6d — Writing Clear Instructions: Demonstration

Demonstrate **3 examples** of writing clear AI instructions for a real goal.

**Template for a strong prompt:**
```
Context:    I am a [grade] student working on [assignment].
Task:       I need you to [specific action].
Format:     Please respond in [format/length/style].
Constraint: Do not [limitation].
```

--

## 6d — Example Prompts

**Example 1 — Campout meal planning:**
```
Context:    I'm a scout planning a 3-day backpacking trip
            for a patrol of 8.
Task:       Suggest a lightweight, nutritious meal plan for
            each day — breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Format:     Bullet list by day, with estimated calories.
Constraint: All meals must require no refrigeration.
```

**Example 2 — Learning a scout skill:**
```
Context:    I'm learning wilderness first aid for my
            First Aid merit badge.
Task:       Walk me through treating a sprained ankle
            on the trail with no hospital nearby.
Format:     Numbered steps, one at a time.
Constraint: Assume only a standard BSA first aid kit.
```

**Example 3 — Merit badge prep:**
```
Context:    I have a merit badge counselor meeting next
            week for Environmental Science.
Task:       Quiz me on the differences between weather
            and climate.
Format:     Ask one question, wait for my answer, then
            tell me if I'm right and explain why.
Constraint: Don't give away the answer before I try.
```

Note: Have scouts write their own prompt for a real scouting goal they have. Then test it live if you have internet access.

## Requirement 7
# 🚀 Practical Application

**Choose ONE of the following:**

--

## Option A — Build an AI Project

**Step 1: Choose a project**
- Something that uses AI to solve a real problem you care about
- Examples: a study assistant, a sports stats analyzer, an image classifier, a chatbot

**Step 2: Develop your plan**
- What is the objective?
- What data will you need?
- What are the ethical considerations?

**Step 3: Implement it**
- Build it using available tools (ChatGPT API, Teachable Machine, ML5.js, etc.)

**Step 4: Share and discuss with your counselor**
- What did you build?
- What worked? What didn't?
- What would you do differently?

Note: Teachable Machine (teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) by Google lets scouts build image/sound classifiers with zero coding — great for beginners.

--

## Option B — Teach AI to Others

Design and deliver a **short lesson on AI** for your patrol or group.

**Your lesson must include:**
- An AI-generated explanation of what AI is (use ChatGPT or similar — then explain how it was made)

- An interactive demonstration relevant to school or scouting

**Suggestions for your demo:**
- Live "AI or Not?" game with your group
- Show how the same prompt can produce different results
- Demonstrate deepfake detection tools
- Show an AI image generator and discuss what it means

Note: Teaching something is the best way to prove you understand it. This option is excellent for scouts who want to work toward the Teaching merit badge or leadership positions.

---
