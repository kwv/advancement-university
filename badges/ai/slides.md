---

## Requirement 1
# Key Concepts & Vocabulary

--

## The Language of AI

Before we go further, let's define the terms:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — computer systems that perform tasks that normally require human intelligence
- **Machine Learning (ML)** — a type of AI where systems learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed
- **Narrow AI** — AI designed to do one specific task (most AI today)
- **General AI** — hypothetical AI that can do *any* intellectual task a human can
- **Superintelligent AI** — hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in every area

Note: Ask scouts which of these they think exists today. Only narrow AI is real and widely deployed. General AI and superintelligent AI remain theoretical.

--

## More Key Terms

- **Automation** — using technology to perform repetitive tasks without human intervention
- **AI Agents** — AI systems that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals
- **Bots** — automated programs that perform tasks over the internet
- **Digital Workers** — AI or software systems that handle business processes previously done by humans

Note: The distinction between automation and AI is important — automation follows fixed rules; AI learns and adapts.

--

## Data and Workflow Terms

- **Data** — raw facts and figures (numbers, text, images, audio) — the fuel that powers AI
- **Database** — organized collection of structured data
- **Variables** — named storage locations that hold data values
- **Tasks** — individual units of work a system performs
- **Triggers** — events or conditions that cause a task to start
- **Workflows** — sequences of tasks that accomplish a larger goal
- **Basic Programming** — instructions written in code that tell a computer what to do
- **Prompt Engineering** — the skill of writing effective instructions for AI systems

Note: The data → trigger → workflow → task chain is how almost all automation and AI systems are structured.

--

## Quick Check

**Match the term to the example:**

| Example | Term |
|---------|------|
| Netflix recommends a show based on your history | Machine Learning |
| Siri answers any question you ask | Narrow AI |
| A chatbot that handles customer service tickets | AI Agent / Bot |
| A system that emails you when a package ships | Trigger + Workflow |
| Your favorite songs — organized | Database |

Note: Go through these quickly as a verbal check. Don't dwell — the rest of the session will reinforce these concepts in context.

---

## Requirement 2
# AI Basics

--

## 2a — AI in Everyday Life

**Can you name 10 examples?** Here are some to get started:

1. Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
2. Social media feed algorithms (what shows up first)
3. Spam filters in email
4. Face unlock on your phone
5. Navigation apps that reroute around traffic
6. Streaming recommendations (Netflix, Spotify, YouTube)
7. Autocorrect and predictive text
8. Smart photo tagging ("here are photos of Mom")
9. Fraud detection on your parents' credit cards
10. Search engine results ranking

Note: Ask scouts to name their own examples before revealing this list. They'll likely name several that aren't here.

--

## 2b — AI in the Workplace

**5 examples:**

1. Resume screening software (reads thousands of applications)
2. Customer service chatbots
3. Predictive maintenance (factories detect machine failures before they happen)
4. Medical imaging analysis (AI spots tumors in X-rays)
5. Supply chain optimization (predicting what to stock and when)

Note: The medical imaging example is particularly powerful — AI can outperform radiologists on specific tasks. Ask: "Does that mean doctors will be replaced?"

--

## 2c — AI in School and Education

**5 examples:**

1. Plagiarism detectors (Turnitin)
2. Personalized learning platforms (Khan Academy's adaptive exercises)
3. AI writing assistants (grammar checkers, suggestions)
4. Automated grading of multiple-choice and even short-answer questions
5. Language learning apps with speech recognition (Duolingo)

Note: This is personal for scouts. Ask them which of these they've actually used.

--

## 2d — "AI or Not?" Game

### Let's Play!

**Rules:**
- Counselor describes a scenario
- You shout **"AI!"** or **"Not AI!"**
- Then we reveal the answer — and why

**12 rounds — ready?**

Note: This is the most interactive part of the session. Keep energy high. Move quickly through rounds. The explanations are on the sub-slides — pause on the scenario slide before advancing.

--

## Round 1

# Basic Calculator

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here. Let scouts answer before advancing.

--

## Round 1 — Answer

# Basic Calculator

## NOT AI

A calculator follows fixed, pre-written rules. It doesn't learn anything. It performs the same operation the same way every single time.

> **Key idea:** If it can't learn or adapt, it's automation — not AI.

--

## Round 2

# Smart Chess Program
### (Improves by analyzing past games)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 2 — Answer

# Smart Chess Program

## AI ✓

It **learns from experience** — analyzing thousands of past games to get better. That's the definition of machine learning.

> DeepMind's AlphaZero taught itself chess in 4 hours and beat the world's best chess engine.

--

## Round 3

# Weather Prediction App
### (Adjusts forecasts based on actual outcomes)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 3 — Answer

# Weather Prediction App

## AI ✓

It **learns from data** — comparing predicted vs. actual weather to improve future forecasts. That's machine learning in action.

> Simple weather apps just show data. Smart forecasting systems actually learn.

--

## Round 4

# Digital Alarm Clock

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 4 — Answer

# Digital Alarm Clock

## NOT AI

It's a **timer-based trigger**. It does exactly what you program it to do, nothing more. No learning, no adaptation.

> Trigger + fixed action = automation, not AI.

--

## Round 5

# Music Recommendation System
### (Suggests songs based on your listening history)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 5 — Answer

# Music Recommendation System

## AI ✓

Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music all use **machine learning** — analyzing your listening history, comparing it to millions of other users, and predicting what you'll like next.

> This is one of the most sophisticated AI systems most people use every day.

--

## Round 6

# Traffic Light Timer
### (Changes at fixed intervals)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 6 — Answer

# Traffic Light Timer

## NOT AI

Fixed timing = **predetermined automation**. The light doesn't know if there are 50 cars waiting or zero cars. It just counts time.

--

## Round 7

# Smart Traffic Management System
### (Adjusts signal timing based on current traffic conditions)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 7 — Answer

# Smart Traffic Management System

## AI ✓

It uses **real-time data** (cameras, sensors, GPS feeds) to make decisions and continuously improve timing. That's AI — learning and adapting to optimize an outcome.

> Cities like Pittsburgh reduced travel time by 25% using AI traffic systems.

--

## Round 8

# Automatic Door at a Store
### (Opens when someone approaches)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 8 — Answer

# Automatic Door

## NOT AI

It's a **motion sensor trigger**. Detect motion → open door. No learning, no decisions, no adaptation.

> Same concept as a light switch — input triggers a fixed output.

--

## Round 9

# Smart Home Security System
### (Learns household patterns, alerts for unusual activity)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 9 — Answer

# Smart Home Security System

## AI ✓

It performs **anomaly detection** — learning what "normal" looks like in your home (when people come and go, typical motion patterns), then flagging things that don't fit.

> Ring and Nest both use this. It's why they stop alerting you about your own car after a week.

--

## Round 10

# Automated Sprinkler System
### (Turns on every day at 6am)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 10 — Answer

# Automated Sprinkler System

## NOT AI

**Timer-based automation**. It runs on schedule regardless of whether it rained last night or if the soil is already saturated.

--

## Round 11

# Smart Irrigation System
### (Adjusts watering based on soil moisture, weather forecast, and plant needs)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 11 — Answer

# Smart Irrigation System

## AI ✓

**Multi-factor decision making** using real-time data from multiple sources. It learns what each zone of your yard needs and when — and adjusts over time.

> This is a great example of AI saving resources — water, energy, money.

--

## Round 12

# Vending Machine

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 12 — Answer

# Vending Machine

## NOT AI

Classic **input → fixed output**. Press B3, get chips. It doesn't learn your preferences, suggest alternatives, or adapt to anything.

> Unless it's a modern vending machine with facial recognition and personalized recommendations — then it IS AI!

--

## 2e — AI Timeline

Create a timeline with **5 key milestones** in AI development.

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1950 | Alan Turing proposes the "Turing Test" as a measure of machine intelligence |
| 1956 | The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined at Dartmouth Conference |
| 1997 | IBM's Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov |
| 2011 | IBM Watson wins Jeopardy! against human champions |
| 2016 | AlphaGo defeats world Go champion — a game considered far harder than chess |
| 2022 | ChatGPT launches, bringing conversational AI to the public |

> Pick 5 that tell a story — from concept to today.

Note: Scouts can use these or research their own. Encourage them to include one milestone that personally surprised them.

---

## Requirement 3
# Automation Basics

--

## 3a — Automation in Everyday Life

**Can you name 10 examples?**

1. Automatic dishwasher cycle
2. Thermostat that adjusts temperature on a schedule
3. Car cruise control
4. Automatic bill payment
5. Email auto-reply ("I'm on vacation...")
6. Elevator floor selection and door timing
7. Vending machines
8. ATM transactions
9. Automatic street lights (on at dusk, off at dawn)
10. Car assembly robots in factories

Note: The line between automation and AI can be blurry — that's intentional. Use examples to reinforce the distinction: automation follows rules, AI learns.

--

## 3b — Automation in the Workplace

**5 examples:**

1. Barcode scanning at checkout
2. Automated email marketing sequences
3. Payroll processing systems
4. Robotic assembly lines in manufacturing

1. Online quiz grading (multiple choice)
2. Attendance tracking systems
3. Library book check-in/check-out scanners
4. Learning management system deadline reminders
5. Automated report card generation

--

## 3d — Why Automation Matters

**It performs repetitive tasks without human intervention**
- Frees humans for creative, judgment-based work
- Works 24/7 without fatigue

**It reduces human error**
- Machines don't get tired, distracted, or forgetful
- Consistent execution every time

**It optimizes resources**
- Faster processing = lower costs
- Better timing = less waste

> The goal isn't to replace humans — it's to handle the work humans shouldn't have to do.

Note: Discuss: "What's something you do regularly that you wish could be automated?"

--

## 3e — Automation Timeline

Create a timeline with **5 milestones** in automation development.

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1785 | Power loom automates textile weaving |
| 1913 | Henry Ford introduces the moving assembly line |
| 1947 | Transistor invented — foundation of all electronic automation |
| 1961 | First industrial robot arm (Unimate) used in a GM factory |
| 1990s | Business process automation software transforms office work |
| 2000s | Robotic process automation (RPA) automates digital tasks |

---

## Requirement 4
# Ethics in AI

--

## 4a — Ethical Concerns in AI

**Bias**
- AI learns from data — if the data is biased, the AI is biased
- Example: facial recognition that works worse for darker skin tones
- Why it happens: training data didn't represent everyone equally

**Privacy**
- AI systems collect and analyze enormous amounts of personal data
- Who owns that data? Who can access it? How long is it kept?
- Example: smart speakers always "listening" for wake words

**AI Decision-Making**
- When AI makes decisions about jobs, loans, parole, medical care — who is accountable?
- Can you appeal a decision made by an algorithm?

Note: These are not abstract concerns — they affect real people. The loan denial and parole examples are real controversies.

--

## 4b — "What Would You Do?" Ethical Scenarios

Play **5 rounds** with your counselor.

**Sample scenarios to discuss:**

1. An AI resume screener rejected your job application before a human ever saw it. What should happen?
2. A friend uses AI to write their entire school essay and submits it as their own work. Is this cheating?
3. A company's AI chatbot gives a customer wrong medical advice. Who is responsible?
4. An AI system predicts a neighborhood has high crime risk — police patrol it more heavily. Is this fair?
5. Your school's AI monitoring software flags your messages as suspicious. You were just venting to a friend. What are your rights?

Note: There are no single right answers. The goal is thoughtful discussion using ethical reasoning.

--

## 4c — Your Own Ethical Guidelines for AI

Develop **your own guidelines** for using AI responsibly.

**Think about:**
- When is it okay to use AI-generated content?
- What information should you never share with an AI?
- How should you verify AI-generated information?
- Who is responsible when AI makes a mistake?
- How should AI treat people differently from how it treats data?

> Write at least 3-5 personal guidelines you would actually follow.

Note: These guidelines are personal — scouts should write ones they believe in, not ones they think the counselor wants to hear.

--

## 4d — The Turing Test

**What is it?**

Proposed by mathematician **Alan Turing** in 1950.

A human judge has text conversations with:
- Another human
- A machine

If the judge **can't reliably tell which is which**, the machine passes the Turing Test.

**Does passing mean the machine is "intelligent"?**

> That's one of the deepest questions in computer science — and it's still debated.

Note: Some philosophers argue the Turing Test only measures the ability to imitate, not true understanding. Ask scouts: "Could ChatGPT pass the Turing Test?"

---

## Requirement 5
# Deepfakes

--

## 5a — What Is a Deepfake?

**Deepfake** — AI-generated media (video, audio, or images) that realistically depicts someone saying or doing something they never said or did.

**How it works:**
- AI analyzes thousands of images/videos of a real person
- It learns to map their facial movements, voice patterns, expressions
- It can then generate convincing fake video of that person

**How it can affect an individual:**
- Damage to reputation — fake videos can go viral
- Emotional harm — seeing yourself in fabricated scenarios
- Financial harm — fake audio used in scams ("grandparent scams")
- Trust erosion — people stop believing *any* video evidence

Note: Show scouts a deepfake detection tool if possible. The FaceForensics++ dataset has examples. The "grandparent scam" (AI mimicking a grandchild's voice to request money) is an active threat.

--

## 5b — What to Do If You're Affected

**If you or someone you know is targeted by a deepfake:**

**Immediate steps:**
- Do NOT share or engage with the content — that spreads it further
- Screenshot and document evidence before it disappears
- Report it to the platform where it appears (most have deepfake policies)
- Tell a trusted adult immediately

**Escalation:**
- Report to school administration if it involves a classmate
- Contact local law enforcement — many states have deepfake laws
- The **Cyber Civil Rights Initiative** (cybercivilrights.org) provides resources

> In most states, creating non-consensual deepfake content is illegal.

Note: Emphasize that this is not a "just ignore it" situation. Deepfakes used to harm individuals — especially minors — are a serious legal matter.

---

## Requirement 6
# Developing AI Skills

--

## 6a — How AI Learns (and Its Limits)

**The AI learning process:**
1. Collect massive amounts of training data
2. Feed it through a model that adjusts based on errors
3. Repeat millions of times until the model performs well
4. Test on data it has never seen before

**Important limitations:**
- AI only knows what's in its training data — no common sense beyond that
- It can "hallucinate" — generate confident-sounding wrong answers
- It has a knowledge cutoff — it doesn't know about recent events
- It can't truly reason — it finds patterns, not understanding
- Biased training data produces biased outputs

Note: The hallucination point is critical for teens using AI for homework. "AI said it" is not a reliable citation.

--

## 6b — Five Methods to Communicate Effectively with AI

1. **Be specific** — vague questions get vague answers
2. **Provide context** — tell the AI who you are and what you're trying to accomplish
3. **Give examples** — show the format or style you want
4. **Iterate** — treat it like a conversation, not a one-shot query
5. **Verify outputs** — always check AI answers against reliable sources

Note: Run a live demo if possible — show a vague prompt vs. a specific prompt and compare the outputs.

--

## 6c — Why Prompt Engineering Matters

**Prompt Engineering** — the skill of writing clear, effective instructions for AI systems.

**Same question, very different results:**

| Weak Prompt | Strong Prompt |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Write an essay" | "Write a 3-paragraph persuasive essay for a 9th grader arguing that schools should start later, using 2 specific research findings" |
| "Explain AI" | "Explain machine learning to a 14-year-old using an analogy involving sports" |
| "Help with math" | "I'm stuck on this algebra problem. Walk me through each step without just giving me the answer" |

> As AI becomes more powerful, knowing how to direct it becomes more valuable.

Note: This is a genuinely marketable skill. Companies are hiring "prompt engineers" right now.

--

## 6d — Writing Clear Instructions: Demonstration

Demonstrate **3 examples** of writing clear AI instructions for school tasks.

**Template for a strong prompt:**
```
Context:    I am a [grade] student working on [assignment].
Task:       I need you to [specific action].
Format:     Please respond in [format/length/style].
Constraint: Do not [limitation].
```

**Example 1 — History paper:**
```
Context:    I am a 10th grader writing a history paper.
Task:       Give me 3 specific causes of World War I,
            each with one concrete example.
Format:     Bullet points, one sentence per cause.
Constraint: Do not write the paper for me — just facts.
```

**Example 2 — Math help:**
```
Context:    I'm a 9th grader stuck on a quadratic equation.
Task:       Walk me through how to factor x² + 5x + 6.
Format:     Step by step, one step at a time.
Constraint: Don't just give the answer — explain each step.
```

**Example 3 — Science study:**
```
Context:    I have a biology test tomorrow on cell division.
Task:       Quiz me on the stages of mitosis.
Format:     Ask one question, wait for my answer, then
            tell me if I'm right and explain why.
Constraint: Don't give away the answer before I try.
```

Note: Have scouts write their own prompt for a real assignment they currently have. Then test it live if you have internet access.
