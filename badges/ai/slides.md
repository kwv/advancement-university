---

## Requirement 1
# 🔑 Key Concepts & Vocabulary

--

## The Language of AI

Before we go further, let's define the terms:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — computer systems that perform tasks that normally require human intelligence
- **Machine Learning (ML)** — a type of AI where systems learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed
- **Narrow AI** — AI designed to do one specific task (most AI today)
- **General AI** — hypothetical AI that can do *any* intellectual task a human can
- **Superintelligent AI** — hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in every area

Note: Ask scouts which of these they think exists today. Only narrow AI is real and widely deployed. General AI and superintelligent AI remain theoretical.

--

## More Key Terms

- **Automation** — using technology to perform repetitive tasks without human intervention
- **AI Agents** — AI systems that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals
- **Bots** — automated programs that perform tasks over the internet
- **Digital Workers** — AI or software systems that handle business processes previously done by humans

Note: The distinction between automation and AI is important — automation follows fixed rules; AI learns and adapts.

--

## Data and Workflow Terms (1/2)

- **Data** — raw facts and figures (numbers, text, images, audio) — the fuel that powers AI
- **Database** — organized collection of structured data
- **Variables** — named storage locations that hold data values
- **Basic Programming** — instructions written in code that tell a computer what to do

Note: These are the foundational building blocks — data is what AI learns from, programming is how you direct it.

--

## Data and Workflow Terms (2/2)

- **Tasks** — individual units of work a system performs
- **Triggers** — events or conditions that cause a task to start
- **Workflows** — sequences of tasks that accomplish a larger goal
- **Prompt Engineering** — the skill of writing effective instructions for AI systems

Note: The data → trigger → workflow → task chain is how almost all automation and AI systems are structured.

--

## Quick Check

**Match the term to the example:**

| Example | Term |
|---------|------|
| Netflix recommends a show based on your history | Machine Learning |
| Siri answers any question you ask | Narrow AI |
| A chatbot that handles customer service tickets | AI Agent / Bot |
| A system that emails you when a package ships | Trigger + Workflow |
| Your favorite songs — organized | Database |

Note: Go through these quickly as a verbal check. Don't dwell — the rest of the session will reinforce these concepts in context.

---

--

## 2d — "AI or Not?" Game

### Let's Play!

**Rules:**
- Counselor describes a scenario
- You shout **"AI!"** or **"Not AI!"**
- Then we reveal the answer — and why

**12 rounds — ready?**

Note: This is the most interactive part of the session. Keep energy high. Move quickly through rounds. The explanations are on the sub-slides — pause on the scenario slide before advancing.

--

## Round 1

# Basic Calculator

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here. Let scouts answer before advancing.

--

## Round 1 — Answer

# Basic Calculator

## NOT AI

A calculator follows fixed, pre-written rules. It doesn't learn anything. It performs the same operation the same way every single time.

> **Key idea:** If it can't learn or adapt, it's automation — not AI.

--

## Round 2

# Smart Chess Program
### (Improves by analyzing past games)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 2 — Answer

# Smart Chess Program

## AI ✓

It **learns from experience** — analyzing thousands of past games to get better. That's the definition of machine learning.

> DeepMind's AlphaZero taught itself chess in 4 hours and beat the world's best chess engine.

--

## Round 3

# Weather Prediction App
### (Adjusts forecasts based on actual outcomes)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 3 — Answer

# Weather Prediction App

## AI ✓

It **learns from data** — comparing predicted vs. actual weather to improve future forecasts. That's machine learning in action.

> Simple weather apps just show data. Smart forecasting systems actually learn.

--

## Round 4

# Digital Alarm Clock

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 4 — Answer

# Digital Alarm Clock

## NOT AI

It's a **timer-based trigger**. It does exactly what you program it to do, nothing more. No learning, no adaptation.

> Trigger + fixed action = automation, not AI.

--

## Round 5

# Music Recommendation System
### (Suggests songs based on your listening history)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 5 — Answer

# Music Recommendation System

## AI ✓

Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music all use **machine learning** — analyzing your listening history, comparing it to millions of other users, and predicting what you'll like next.

> This is one of the most sophisticated AI systems most people use every day.

--

## Round 6

# Traffic Light Timer
### (Changes at fixed intervals)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 6 — Answer

# Traffic Light Timer

## NOT AI

Fixed timing = **predetermined automation**. The light doesn't know if there are 50 cars waiting or zero cars. It just counts time.

--

## Round 7

# Smart Traffic Management System
### (Adjusts signal timing based on current traffic conditions)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 7 — Answer

# Smart Traffic Management System

## AI ✓

It uses **real-time data** (cameras, sensors, GPS feeds) to make decisions and continuously improve timing. That's AI — learning and adapting to optimize an outcome.

> Cities like Pittsburgh reduced travel time by 25% using AI traffic systems.

--

## Round 8

# Automatic Door at a Store
### (Opens when someone approaches)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 8 — Answer

# Automatic Door

## NOT AI

It's a **motion sensor trigger**. Detect motion → open door. No learning, no decisions, no adaptation.

> Same concept as a light switch — input triggers a fixed output.

--

## Round 9

# Smart Home Security System
### (Learns household patterns, alerts for unusual activity)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 9 — Answer

# Smart Home Security System

## AI ✓

It performs **anomaly detection** — learning what "normal" looks like in your home (when people come and go, typical motion patterns), then flagging things that don't fit.

> Ring and Nest both use this. It's why they stop alerting you about your own car after a week.

--

## Round 10

# Automated Sprinkler System
### (Turns on every day at 6am)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

# Smart Irrigation System
### (Adjusts watering based on soil moisture, weather forecast, and plant needs)

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 11 — Answer

# Smart Irrigation System

## AI ✓

**Multi-factor decision making** using real-time data from multiple sources. It learns what each zone of your yard needs and when — and adjusts over time.

> This is a great example of AI saving resources — water, energy, money.

--

## Round 12

# Vending Machine

**AI or Not AI?**

Note: Pause here.

--

## Round 12 — Answer

# Vending Machine

## NOT AI

Classic **input → fixed output**. Press B3, get chips. It doesn't learn your preferences, suggest alternatives, or adapt to anything.

> Unless it's a modern vending machine with facial recognition and personalized recommendations — then it IS AI!

--

## 2e — AI Timeline

Create a timeline with **5 key milestones** in AI development.

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|

| 2016 | AlphaGo defeats world Go champion — a game considered far harder than chess |
| 2022 | ChatGPT launches, bringing conversational AI to the public |

> Pick 5 that tell a story — from concept to today.

Note: Scouts can use these or research their own. Encourage them to include one milestone that personally surprised them.

---

## Requirement 3
# ⚙️ Automation Basics

--

## 3a — Automation in Everyday Life

**Can you name 10 examples?**

*Think about things that happen automatically — no human pushing a button each time...*

Note: Give scouts time to brainstorm out loud. Then advance. Reinforce the distinction: automation follows fixed rules, AI learns.

--

2. Attendance tracking systems
3. Library book check-in/check-out scanners
4. Learning management system deadline reminders
5. Automated report card generation

--

## 3d — Why Automation Matters

**It performs repetitive tasks without human intervention**
- Frees humans for creative, judgment-based work
- Works 24/7 without fatigue

**It reduces human error**
- Machines don't get tired, distracted, or forgetful
- Consistent execution every time

**It optimizes resources**
- Faster processing = lower costs
- Better timing = less waste

> The goal isn't to replace humans — it's to handle the work humans shouldn't have to do.

Note: Discuss: "What's something you do regularly that you wish could be automated?"

--

## 3e — Automation Timeline

Create a timeline with **5 milestones** in automation development.

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1785 | Power loom automates textile weaving |
| 1913 | Henry Ford introduces the moving assembly line |
| 1947 | Transistor invented — foundation of all electronic automation |
| 1961 | First industrial robot arm (Unimate) used in a GM factory |
| 1990s | Business process automation software transforms office work |
| 2000s | Robotic process automation (RPA) automates digital tasks |

---

## Requirement 4
# ⚖️ Ethics in AI

--

## 4a — Ethical Concerns: Bias & Privacy

**🎯 Bias**
- AI learns from data — if the data is biased, the AI is biased
- Example: facial recognition that works worse for darker skin tones
- Why it happens: training data didn't represent everyone equally

**🔒 Privacy**
- AI systems collect and analyze enormous amounts of personal data
- Who owns that data? Who can access it? How long is it kept?
- Example: smart speakers always "listening" for wake words

Note: These are not abstract concerns — they affect real people. The loan denial and parole examples are real controversies.

--

## 4a — Ethical Concerns: AI Decision-Making

**🤖 AI Decision-Making**
- When AI makes decisions about jobs, loans, parole, medical care — who is accountable?
- Can you appeal a decision made by an algorithm?
- Should there always be a human in the loop for high-stakes decisions?

> As AI gets more powerful, these questions become more urgent — not less.

--

## 4b — "What Would You Do?" Ethical Scenarios

Play **5 rounds** with your counselor.

**Sample scenarios to discuss:**

1. An AI resume screener rejected your job application before a human ever saw it. What should happen?
2. A scout uses AI to write their entire Eagle Scout project report and submits it as their own work. Is this a problem?
3. A company's AI chatbot gives a customer wrong medical advice. Who is responsible?
4. An AI system predicts a neighborhood has high crime risk — police patrol it more heavily. Is this fair?
5. Your school's AI monitoring software flags your messages as suspicious. You were just venting to a friend. What are your rights?

Note: There are no single right answers. The goal is thoughtful discussion using ethical reasoning.

--

## 4c — Your Own Ethical Guidelines for AI

Develop **your own guidelines** for using AI responsibly.

**Think about:**
- When is it okay to use AI-generated content?
- What information should you never share with an AI?
- How should you verify AI-generated information?
- Who is responsible when AI makes a mistake?
- How should AI treat people differently from how it treats data?

> Write at least 3-5 personal guidelines you would actually follow.

Note: These guidelines are personal — scouts should write ones they believe in, not ones they think the counselor wants to hear.

--

## 4d — The Turing Test

**What is it?**

Proposed by mathematician **Alan Turing** in 1950.

A human judge has text conversations with:
- Another human
- A machine

If the judge **can't reliably tell which is which**, the machine passes the Turing Test.

**Does passing mean the machine is "intelligent"?**

> That's one of the deepest questions in computer science — and it's still debated.

Note: Some philosophers argue the Turing Test only measures the ability to imitate, not true understanding. Ask scouts: "Could ChatGPT pass the Turing Test?"

---

## Requirement 5
# 🎭 Deepfakes

--

## 5a — What Is a Deepfake?

**Deepfake** — AI-generated media (video, audio, or images) that realistically depicts someone saying or doing something they never said or did.

**How it works:**
- AI analyzes thousands of images/videos of a real person
- It learns to map their facial movements, voice patterns, expressions
- It can then generate convincing fake video of that person

--

## 5a — How Deepfakes Affect Individuals

**How it can affect an individual:**
- 😰 Damage to reputation — fake videos can go viral
- 💔 Emotional harm — seeing yourself in fabricated scenarios
- 💸 Financial harm — fake audio used in scams ("grandparent scams")
- ❓ Trust erosion — people stop believing *any* video evidence

> The "grandparent scam" — AI mimicking a grandchild's voice to request money — is an active and growing threat.

Note: Show scouts a deepfake detection tool if possible. The FaceForensics++ dataset has examples. The "grandparent scam" (AI mimicking a grandchild's voice to request money) is an active threat.

--

## 5b — What to Do If You're Affected

**If you or someone you know is targeted by a deepfake:**

**Immediate steps:**
- Do NOT share or engage with the content — that spreads it further
- Screenshot and document evidence before it disappears
- Report it to the platform where it appears (most have deepfake policies)
- Tell a trusted adult immediately

**Escalation:**
- Report to school administration if it involves a classmate
- Contact local law enforcement — many states have deepfake laws
- The **Cyber Civil Rights Initiative** (cybercivilrights.org) provides resources

> In most states, creating non-consensual deepfake content is illegal.

Note: Emphasize that this is not a "just ignore it" situation. Deepfakes used to harm individuals — especially minors — are a serious legal matter.

---

## Requirement 6
# 🛠️ Developing AI Skills

--

## 6a — How AI Learns (and Its Limits)

**The AI learning process:**
1. Collect massive amounts of training data
2. Feed it through a model that adjusts based on errors
3. Repeat millions of times until the model performs well
4. Test on data it has never seen before

**Important limitations:**
- AI only knows what's in its training data — no common sense beyond that
- It can "hallucinate" — generate confident-sounding wrong answers
- It has a knowledge cutoff — it doesn't know about recent events
- It can't truly reason — it finds patterns, not understanding
- Biased training data produces biased outputs

Note: The hallucination point is critical for teens using AI for homework. "AI said it" is not a reliable citation.

--

## 6b — Five Methods to Communicate Effectively with AI

1. **Be specific** — vague questions get vague answers
2. **Provide context** — tell the AI who you are and what you're trying to accomplish
3. **Give examples** — show the format or style you want
4. **Iterate** — treat it like a conversation, not a one-shot query
5. **Verify outputs** — always check AI answers against reliable sources

Note: Run a live demo if possible — show a vague prompt vs. a specific prompt and compare the outputs.

--

## 6c — Why Prompt Engineering Matters

**Prompt Engineering** — the skill of writing clear, effective instructions for AI systems.

**Same question, very different results:**

| Weak Prompt | Strong Prompt |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Plan a campout" | "Plan a 3-day backpacking menu for 8 scouts. All meals must need no refrigeration. Include estimated calories per meal." |
| "Explain AI" | "Explain machine learning to a 14-year-old using an analogy involving sports" |
| "Help me tie a knot" | "I'm learning to tie a bowline. Walk me through each step, describing what the rope should look like at each stage." |

> As AI becomes more powerful, knowing how to direct it becomes more valuable.

Note: This is a genuinely marketable skill. Companies are hiring "prompt engineers" right now.

--

## 6d — Writing Clear Instructions: Demonstration

Demonstrate **3 examples** of writing clear AI instructions for a real goal.

**Template for a strong prompt:**
```
Context:    I am a [grade] student working on [assignment].
Task:       I need you to [specific action].
Format:     Please respond in [format/length/style].
Constraint: Do not [limitation].
```

--

## 6d — Example Prompts

**Example 1 — Campout meal planning:**
```
Context:    I'm a scout planning a 3-day backpacking trip
            for a patrol of 8.
Task:       Suggest a lightweight, nutritious meal plan for
            each day — breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Format:     Bullet list by day, with estimated calories.
Constraint: All meals must require no refrigeration.
```

**Example 2 — Learning a scout skill:**
```
Context:    I'm learning wilderness first aid for my
            First Aid merit badge.
Task:       Walk me through treating a sprained ankle
            on the trail with no hospital nearby.
Format:     Numbered steps, one at a time.
Constraint: Assume only a standard BSA first aid kit.
```

**Example 3 — Merit badge prep:**
```
Context:    I have a merit badge counselor meeting next
            week for Environmental Science.
Task:       Quiz me on the differences between weather
            and climate.
Format:     Ask one question, wait for my answer, then
            tell me if I'm right and explain why.
Constraint: Don't give away the answer before I try.
```

Note: Have scouts write their own prompt for a real scouting goal they have. Then test it live if you have internet access.
