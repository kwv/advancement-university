## Agenda

- Req 1 — Safety
- Req 2 — History of Programming
- Req 3 — General Knowledge
- Req 4 — Intellectual Property
- Req 5 — Your Programming Projects
- Req 6 — Careers

Note: Welcome scouts! Today we're exploring programming — one of the most in-demand skills of the 21st century. Let's dig in.

---

## Requirement 1
# 🛡️ Safety

--

## 1a — Digital Safety Video

Watch the **Personal Safety Awareness "Digital Safety"** video

- Watch with a parent or guardian
- Be ready to discuss what you learned with your counselor

> Parent/guardian permission is required before viewing.

Note: This video covers important online safety topics. Confirm with scouts that they have watched it with a parent or guardian before this session.

--

## 1b — Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI)

*Caused by long sessions of typing, clicking, and scrolling*

<div class="cols">
<div>

**Symptoms**
- Pain, stiffness, or weakness
- Swelling, tingling, or numbness
- Sore neck, shoulders, or arms
- Sensitivity to cold or heat

</div>
<div>

**Prevention**
- ⌨️ Ergonomic keyboard & wrist rest
- 🪑 Adjust chair and monitor height
- ⏱️ Break every 30–60 minutes

</div>
</div>

> Good habits from day one make a huge difference.

Note: Ask scouts: "Have any of you ever had sore wrists or headaches after a long gaming or coding session?" This makes it real.

--

## 1b — RSI: If Symptoms Develop

> Caught early, RSI damage is not permanent.

- 🛑 **Stop** — rest the affected area right away
- 🧊 Ice can reduce swelling in the short term
- 🔄 Revisit your setup so the problem doesn't return
- 🩺 Symptoms that persist or worsen → see a doctor

Note: Keep this brief and reassuring — the message is "this is fixable if you catch it early," not alarm. Most scouts won't have RSI yet; the goal is awareness so they recognize it if it starts.

--

## 1b — Eyestrain

### ✨ The 20-20-20 Rule

Every **20 min** → look **20 feet** away → for **20 seconds**

<div class="cols">
<div>

💡 Match screen brightness to the room

📏 Monitor at arm's length, near eye level

</div>
<div>

🌙 Enable dark mode or night shift

🔤 Increase text size if you're squinting

</div>
</div>

> Small adjustments eliminate dry eyes, headaches, and long-term strain.

Note: Mention f.lux or built-in night mode as practical tools scouts can use today.

--

## 1b — Eyestrain Symptoms & Recovery

<div class="cols">
<div>

**Symptoms**
- Sore, tired, burning, or itching eyes
- Watery or dry eyes
- Blurred or double vision
- Headache or light sensitivity
- Difficulty concentrating

</div>
<div>

**Recovery**
- Step away — rest your eyes
- A consistent sleep schedule helps eyes recover overnight
- Symptoms that persist → see an eye doctor

</div>
</div>

> The habits that prevent eyestrain also treat it.

Note: Most eyestrain resolves on its own with rest. The goal is recognition — scouts should know when to step away, not memorize a treatment protocol.

---

## Requirement 2
# ⏳ History of Programming

![IBM 1401 Punch Card](punch-card.jpg)
--

## Where Did It All Start?

**Discussion prompt:**

What do you think the very first "program" looked like?

- Paper punch cards?
- Binary ones and zeros?
- Something else entirely?

Note: Let scouts speculate before revealing history. This builds curiosity.

--

## Key Milestones

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1843 | 💡 Ada Lovelace writes "Note G" — the first algorithm, for Babbage's Analytical Machine |
| 1952 | Autocode — the first compiled language; COBOL and FORTRAN soon follow |
| 1972 | C released — still powers most of the world's systems |
| 1991 | 💡 Python — designed for readability and ease of use |
| 1995 | JavaScript — the language that makes the web interactive |
| 2006 | **Roblox** launches — introducing millions to Luau (and game dev) |
| 2009 | **Minecraft** (Java Edition) — sparks a global interest in modding |
| 2021 | GitHub Copilot — AI begins helping humans write code |

**You need at least 3 milestones — pick the ones that interest you most.**

Note: Have scouts identify the milestones they find most interesting and explain why. This prepares them for the counselor discussion.

--

## How Far We've Come

**Machine code (1940s) — binary:**
```
10110000 01100001
```

**Assembly (1950s) — human-readable mnemonics:**
```asm
MOV AL, 61h
```

**Python (today) — almost plain English:**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

> Same instruction to the computer. Three very different ways to write it.

Note: This single slide makes the entire history tangible. Let it sink in.

--

## Discussion with Your Counselor

> Be ready to talk about:
> - Why did programming languages evolve toward being more human-readable?
> - What problems did each new language try to solve?
> - Why do we still have dozens of different languages today instead of just one?

Note: **Key answers to draw out:** (1) Human-readable code reduces bugs and makes teamwork possible — a team of 50 engineers can't collaborate in machine code. (2) Each generation solved the previous era's limits: assembly abstracted raw binary, C enabled portability across machines, C++ added object-oriented structure, Python and Ruby prioritized developer speed over machine speed. (3) No single language dominates because different constraints matter — game engines need C++ performance, data science needs Python's library ecosystem, and JavaScript is locked into browsers by 30 years of history. **Great follow-up:** "If you could design the perfect programming language from scratch today, what would it look like?"

---

## Requirement 3
# 🧠 General Knowledge

--

## 3a — Popular Programming Languages Today

Create your own list of **5 popular languages** — which industries use them and why.

*Think about: web, games, apps, science, business, hardware...*

Note: Give scouts time to brainstorm their own list before advancing. There's no single right answer.

--

## 3a — Popular Programming Languages Today

| Language | Industries | Why It Fits |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Python | AI, data science, web | Readable syntax, massive library ecosystem |
| JavaScript | Web, mobile apps | Runs natively in every browser |
| Java | Enterprise software, Android | "Write once, run anywhere" |
| Swift | iOS and macOS apps | Built by Apple for Apple devices |
| C++ | Games, systems, hardware | Extremely fast and low-level |

> Also worth researching: SQL, Rust, Go, Kotlin, Ruby, R

--

## 3b — Programmed Devices You Rely On Every Day

**Discussion:** Name devices around you right now that run software.

*Look beyond phones and computers — further than you think...*

> Describe **3 devices**: what they do, what the program controls, and what would happen without it.

Note: Push scouts beyond obvious devices before advancing. Almost everything electronic has firmware or software inside it.

--

## 3b — Programmed Devices You Rely On Every Day

- 📱 **Smartphone** — apps, GPS, camera processing
- 🍽️ **Microwave** — timing sequences and power control
- 🚗 **Car** — engine management, antilock brakes, navigation
- 📺 **Smart TV** — streaming, recommendations, interface
- 🚦 **Traffic lights** — timing cycles, sensors, coordination

> What would happen if the software stopped working in each of these?

---

## Requirement 4
# ⚖️ Intellectual Property

--

## 4a — Four Types of IP (1/2)

**©️ Copyright**
- Automatic the moment you create something
- Protects the specific code you wrote
- Lasts your lifetime plus 70 years

**📜 Patent**
- Protects an invention or novel method
- Must be applied for — expensive and slow
- Lasts **20 years** from the filing date; no automatic renewal
- Example: a new compression algorithm or data structure

> Ask yourself: "Which type automatically protects the code you write for this badge?" (Copyright!)

Note: Ask scouts: "Which type automatically protects the code you write for this badge?" (Copyright — no registration needed!)

--

## 4a — Four Types of IP (2/2)

**™️ Trademark**
- Protects names, logos, and brands
- Lasts **indefinitely** as long as it's actively used and renewed
- Example: the Python logo, the name "Java"

**🤫 Trade Secret**
- Kept confidential — never registered publicly
- Example: Google's search ranking algorithm

| Type | Protection | Registration? |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Copyright | Your specific code | Automatic |
| Patent | Inventions & methods | Required (expensive) |
| Trademark | Names, logos, brands | Required |
| Trade Secret | Confidential info | Never public |

--

## 4b — Licensing vs. Owning Software

| Licensing | Owning |
|-----------|--------|
| You buy the *right to use* it | You own the actual product |
| The company can change terms or revoke access | You control it completely |
| Overwhelmingly the most common model | Rare for software |
| Example: Microsoft 365 subscription | Example: purchasing source code outright |

> When you "buy" an app, you are almost always **licensing** it — not owning it.

Note: This surprises most people. Pull up a Terms of Service agreement and show scouts the "license grant" language.

--

## 4c — Three Software Categories

<div class="cols">
<div>

**Freeware**
- Free to use, source code closed
- Cannot see, modify, or redistribute
- _Zoom (free tier), Acrobat Reader_

**Open Source**
- Source code publicly available
- Use, study, modify, and distribute freely
- _Linux, Python, VS Code, Firefox, VLC_

</div>
<div>

**Commercial Software**
- You pay to use it; code is proprietary
- _Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office_

<br>

> Many tools blur the lines — VS Code is both free **and** open source!

</div>
</div>

--

## 4c — Why Respecting Terms of Use Matters

- 🚫 **Freeware:** using it commercially when the license says personal-only is theft
- 🔄 **Open source:** if you modify and distribute, you may be required to share your changes
- 💰 **Commercial:** copying or sharing licenses violates contracts and copyright law

Note: Discussion: "If you write a program, which category would you want it to be? Why?" Follow up: "What happens if someone violates the terms of use — to the user, and to the developer?"

---

## Requirement 5
# 💻 Your Programming Projects

The main event.

--

## What You Need to Do

Work with your counselor to select **3 different programming languages** and development environments.

For **each language**, you will:

1. Write or modify a program
2. The program must accept **input** and produce **output**
3. It must include **computation or decision-making**
4. **Debug** the program — find and fix errors
5. **Demonstrate** it live to your counselor
6. **Explain** how it works: inputs, decisions, outputs

> **Demonstrate to your counselor:** Run the program live, fix any errors in real time, and explain the inputs, logic, and outputs.

Note: Counselors — help scouts choose languages at appropriate difficulty levels. Good combos: Python + JavaScript + Scratch, or Python + Java + HTML/CSS.

--

## Input → Processing → Output

Every program does some version of this:

```
    INPUT              PROCESSING             OUTPUT
  ----------        ----------------        ----------
  User types    →   Compare answer    →   "Correct!" or
  an answer         to correct value      "Try again!"


  Temperature   →   Multiply by 9/5   →   Temperature
  in Celsius        then add 32           in Fahrenheit


  Shopping list →   Calculate total   →   "Your total
  of items          with tax              is $24.37"
```

> Describe your own program using this same framework.

Note: Have scouts sketch out their program idea using this input/processing/output structure before writing any code.

--

## What Makes a Good Project?

<div class="cols">
<div>

**Your program must have all three:**

📥 **Input** — typed text, clicks, or data from a file

⚙️ **Processing** — calculation, decision, or transformation

📤 **Output** — something visible, audible, or usable

</div>
<div>

**Examples that fully qualify:**
- Quiz game with score tracking
- Temperature or unit converter
- Number guessing game with hints
- To-do list that stores items
- Calculator with multiple operations

</div>
</div>

Note: Complexity is not the goal. Demonstrating understanding of input, processing, and output is the goal.

--

## Debugging: Finding and Fixing Errors

<div class="cols">
<div>

**Three Error Types**

🔴 **Syntax** — code the language can't parse (typo in keyword)

🟡 **Logic** — runs, but gives wrong answers

🟠 **Runtime** — crashes while executing

</div>
<div>

**Strategies That Work**
- Error messages include the line number — read them
- Add `print()` to inspect variables mid-run
- Test with simple, known inputs first
- Ask: "What did I *expect*? What *happened*?"

</div>
</div>

> Professionals spend more than half their time debugging. It's not failure — it's the job.

Note: Normalize debugging early and often. Share a time you spent hours on a bug that turned out to be a simple typo.

--

## Language Ideas by Difficulty

<div class="cols">
<div>

**🟢 Beginner**
- Scratch — block-based, drag-and-drop
- Python — reads almost like English
- HTML + basic JavaScript — instant browser results

**🟡 Intermediate**
- JavaScript — web pages, games, APIs
- Java — structured, school and industry
- Swift Playgrounds — iOS coding on iPad

</div>
<div>

**🔴 Advanced**
- C or C++ — fast, games and hardware
- Rust — modern systems, growing fast
- TypeScript — typed JavaScript for larger projects

<br>

> Pick 3 that challenge you. At least one should be new to you.

</div>
</div>

--

## Explaining Your Program to Your Counselor

Be ready to answer these questions for each project:

- What **input** does your program take?
- What **decisions** does it make? (if/else, loops, comparisons)
- What **output** does it produce?
- What **bugs** did you find, and how did you fix them?
- What would you add or improve if you had more time?

> Talking through your own code is a real professional skill — developers do "code reviews" every day.

---

## Requirement 6
# 🎯 Careers

**Choose ONE of the following:**

--

## Option A — Research a Programming Career

Pick **one career** in programming and investigate:

- What **education or training** is required?
- What are the **costs** to get qualified (school, bootcamp, self-study)?
- What are the **job prospects** — demand, growth outlook?
- What is the typical **salary range** in your area?
- What are the **day-to-day duties**?
- What does **career advancement** look like?

> Then discuss your findings with your counselor.

Note: Good careers to research: software engineer, web developer, game developer, data scientist, DevOps engineer, embedded systems programmer, mobile developer. **Salary benchmarks (2024–2025):** Entry-level software engineer: $70K–$95K; mid-level: $110K–$150K; senior: $150K–$220K+. Top tech companies pay $200K–$400K+ including stock. Game developer salaries run 15–20% lower than general software on average, but senior/lead roles at AAA studios are competitive. **Education paths:** CS degree (4 years, $40K–$200K total); coding bootcamp (3–6 months, $10K–$20K); self-taught is fully viable, especially for web/mobile. **Key insight for scouts:** Employers value a strong GitHub portfolio and internship experience far more than certifications for most software roles — what you've built matters more than credentials.

--

## Option B — Programming as a Hobby or Healthy Lifestyle

How could programming support something you already love?

**Real examples:**
- Automate stats tracking for a sport you play
- Build tools for a creative hobby — music, art, writing
- Create fitness or habit tracking apps
- Program robots, drones, or smart home devices for fun
- Make mods for games you already play

--

## Option B (continued)

**Research:**
- Training resources available (free and paid)
- Typical expenses (hardware, software, classes)
- Organizations and communities you could join

> **Then discuss with your counselor:**
> - What **short-term goals** could you achieve in the next 6-12 months?
> - What **long-term goals** might this hobby lead to in 3-5 years?

Note: This option is great for scouts who aren't targeting a tech career but want to apply programming to their passions. **Prompts for short-term goals (6–12 months):** "Build a Python script that tracks stats for my sport," "Learn HTML/CSS and build a personal website," "Complete 30 days of coding challenges on LeetCode or Codewars," "Build a Discord bot for my gaming community," "Mod a game I already play." **Long-term (3–5 years):** "Freelance on small web projects," "Build and publish a mobile app," "Contribute to an open-source project I use." Help scouts connect the goal to something they already love — motivation is the hardest part of learning to code, and a real project beats any tutorial.
