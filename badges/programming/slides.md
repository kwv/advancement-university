# Programming Merit Badge ⚜️
## BSA Merit Badge

**Boy Scouts of America**

---

## Agenda

- Req 1 — Safety
- Req 2 — History of Programming
- Req 3 — General Knowledge
- Req 4 — Intellectual Property
- Req 5 — Your Programming Projects
- Req 6 — Careers

Note: Welcome scouts! Today we're exploring programming — one of the most in-demand skills of the 21st century. Let's dig in.

---

## Requirement 1
# 🛡️ Safety

--

## 1a — Digital Safety Video

Watch the **Personal Safety Awareness "Digital Safety"** video

- Watch with a parent or guardian
- Be ready to discuss what you learned with your counselor

> Parent/guardian permission is required before viewing.

Note: This video covers important online safety topics. Confirm with scouts that they have watched it with a parent or guardian before this session.

--

## 1b — Staying Healthy While Coding

**Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSI)**

- Caused by long sessions of typing, clicking, and scrolling
- Symptoms: wrist pain, tingling fingers, sore neck and shoulders
- Prevention: wrist rests, ergonomic keyboards, frequent breaks

**Eyestrain**

- Caused by staring at a screen without breaks
- The **20-20-20 rule**: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds
- Adjust monitor brightness, contrast, and distance

> Real programmers deal with these. Good habits from day one make a huge difference.

Note: Ask scouts: "Have any of you ever had sore wrists or headaches after a long gaming or coding session?" This makes it real.

---

## Requirement 2
# ⏳ History of Programming

--

## Where Did It All Start?

**Discussion prompt:**

What do you think the very first "program" looked like?

- Paper punch cards?
- Binary ones and zeros?
- Something else entirely?

Note: Let scouts speculate before revealing history. This builds curiosity.

--

## Key Milestones

| Year | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1843 | 💡 Ada Lovelace writes the first algorithm — for a machine that didn't exist yet |
| 1940s | Machine code — raw binary instructions, tedious and error-prone |
| 1950s | Assembly language — first step toward human-readable code |
| 1957 | 💡 FORTRAN — first high-level language, built for science and math |
| 1972 | C — still powers operating systems and hardware today |
| 1991 | 💡 Python — designed to be readable as plain English |
| 1995 | Java, JavaScript, and PHP all released the same year |
| 2009 | Go — built by Google for modern, scalable systems |

**You need at least 3 milestones — pick the ones that interest you most.**

Note: Have scouts identify the milestones they find most interesting and explain why. This prepares them for the counselor discussion.

--

## How Far We've Come

**Machine code (1940s) — binary:**
```
10110000 01100001
```

**Assembly (1950s) — human-readable mnemonics:**
```asm
MOV AL, 61h
```

**Python (today) — almost plain English:**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

> Same instruction to the computer. Three very different ways to write it.

Note: This single slide makes the entire history tangible. Let it sink in.

--

## Discussion with Your Counselor

Be ready to talk about:

- Why did programming languages evolve toward being more human-readable?
- What problems did each new language try to solve?
- Why do we still have dozens of different languages today instead of just one?

---

## Requirement 3
# 🧠 General Knowledge

--

## 3a — Popular Programming Languages Today

Create your own list of **5 popular languages** — which industries use them and why.

| Language | Industries | Why It Fits |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Python | AI, data science, web | Readable syntax, massive library ecosystem |
| JavaScript | Web, mobile apps | Runs natively in every browser |
| Java | Enterprise software, Android | "Write once, run anywhere" |
| Swift | iOS and macOS apps | Built by Apple for Apple devices |
| C++ | Games, systems, hardware | Extremely fast and low-level |

> Also worth researching: SQL, Rust, Go, Kotlin, Ruby, R

Note: Scouts should build their own list — these are examples, not the answer. Encourage them to research languages they're personally curious about.

--

## 3b — Programmed Devices You Rely On Every Day

**Discussion:** Name devices around you right now that run software

Examples to get you thinking:

- 📱 **Smartphone** — apps, GPS, camera processing
- 🍽️ **Microwave** — timing sequences and power control
- 🚗 **Car** — engine management, antilock brakes, navigation
- 📺 **Smart TV** — streaming, recommendations, interface
- 🚦 **Traffic lights** — timing cycles, sensors, coordination

> Describe **3 devices**: what they do, what the program controls, and what would happen without it.

Note: Push scouts beyond obvious computers. Almost everything electronic has firmware or software running inside it.

---

## Requirement 4
# ⚖️ Intellectual Property

--

## 4a — Four Types of IP (1/2)

**©️ Copyright**
- Automatic the moment you create something
- Protects the specific code you wrote
- Lasts your lifetime plus 70 years

**📜 Patent**
- Protects an invention or novel method
- Must be applied for — expensive and slow
- Example: a new compression algorithm or data structure

> Ask yourself: "Which type automatically protects the code you write for this badge?" (Copyright!)

Note: Ask scouts: "Which type automatically protects the code you write for this badge?" (Copyright — no registration needed!)

--

## 4a — Four Types of IP (2/2)

**™️ Trademark**
- Protects names, logos, and brands
- Example: the Python logo, the name "Java"

**🤫 Trade Secret**
- Kept confidential — never registered publicly
- Example: Google's search ranking algorithm

| Type | Protection | Registration? |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Copyright | Your specific code | Automatic |
| Patent | Inventions & methods | Required (expensive) |
| Trademark | Names, logos, brands | Required |
| Trade Secret | Confidential info | Never public |

--

## 4b — Licensing vs. Owning Software

| Licensing | Owning |
|-----------|--------|
| You buy the *right to use* it | You own the actual product |
| The company can change terms or revoke access | You control it completely |
| Overwhelmingly the most common model | Rare for software |
| Example: Microsoft 365 subscription | Example: purchasing source code outright |

> When you "buy" an app, you are almost always **licensing** it — not owning it.

Note: This surprises most people. Pull up a Terms of Service agreement and show scouts the "license grant" language.

--

## 4c — Three Software Categories

**Freeware**
- Free to use, but source code is closed
- You cannot see, modify, or redistribute the code
- Examples: Zoom (free tier), Adobe Acrobat Reader

**Open Source**
- Source code is public and freely available
- Anyone can use, study, modify, and distribute it
- Examples: Linux, Python, VS Code, Firefox, VLC

**Commercial Software**
- You pay to use it; source code is proprietary
- Examples: Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft Office

> Many tools blur the lines — VS Code is both free *and* open source!

--

## 4c — Why Respecting Terms of Use Matters

- 🚫 **Freeware:** using it commercially when the license says personal-only is theft
- 🔄 **Open source:** if you modify and distribute, you may be required to share your changes
- 💰 **Commercial:** copying or sharing licenses violates contracts and copyright law

Note: Discussion: "If you write a program, which category would you want it to be? Why?" Follow up: "What happens if someone violates the terms of use — to the user, and to the developer?"

---

## Requirement 5
# 💻 Your Programming Projects

The main event.

--

## What You Need to Do

Work with your counselor to select **3 different programming languages** and development environments.

For **each language**, you will:

1. Write or modify a program
2. The program must accept **input** and produce **output**
3. It must include **computation or decision-making**
4. **Debug** the program — find and fix errors
5. **Demonstrate** it live to your counselor
6. **Explain** how it works: inputs, decisions, outputs

Note: Counselors — help scouts choose languages at appropriate difficulty levels. Good combos: Python + JavaScript + Scratch, or Python + Java + HTML/CSS.

--

## Input → Processing → Output

Every program does some version of this:

```
    INPUT              PROCESSING             OUTPUT
  ----------        ----------------        ----------
  User types    →   Compare answer    →   "Correct!" or
  an answer         to correct value      "Try again!"


  Temperature   →   Multiply by 9/5   →   Temperature
  in Celsius        then add 32           in Fahrenheit


  Shopping list →   Calculate total   →   "Your total
  of items          with tax              is $24.37"
```

> Describe your own program using this same framework.

Note: Have scouts sketch out their program idea using this input/processing/output structure before writing any code.

--

## What Makes a Good Project for This Badge?

Your program should:

- Accept **input** from the user (typed text, button click, file, sensor)
- **Process** it — perform a calculation, make a decision, transform the data
- Produce **output** the user can see, hear, or use

**Simple examples that fully qualify:**
- A quiz game that checks your answers and keeps score
- A temperature or unit converter
- A number guessing game with hints ("higher / lower")
- A simple to-do list that stores and displays items
- A calculator with multiple operations

Note: Emphasize: complexity is not the goal. Demonstrating understanding of input, processing, and output is the goal.

--

## Debugging: Finding and Fixing Errors

**Three types of errors you'll encounter:**

- 🔴 **Syntax error** — you wrote something the language can't understand (like a typo in a keyword)
- 🟡 **Logic error** — the program runs but gives wrong answers
- 🟠 **Runtime error** — the program crashes while running

**Strategies that work:**
- Read error messages carefully — they usually include the line number
- Add `print()` statements to inspect what your variables contain
- Test with simple, known inputs first
- Ask yourself: "What did I *expect* to happen? What actually happened?"

> Professional programmers spend more than half their time debugging. It is not failure — it is the job.

Note: Normalize debugging early and often. Share a time you spent hours on a bug that turned out to be a simple typo.

--

## Language Ideas by Difficulty

**Beginner-Friendly**
- Scratch — block-based, drag-and-drop, visual results
- Python — reads almost like English, huge community
- HTML + basic JavaScript — see results instantly in a browser

**Intermediate**
- JavaScript — interactive web pages, games, APIs
- Java — structured, widely used in school and industry
- Swift Playgrounds — iOS-style coding on iPad or Mac

**Advanced**
- C or C++ — low-level, fast, used in games and hardware
- Rust — modern systems programming, growing fast
- TypeScript — typed JavaScript for larger projects

> Pick 3 that challenge you. At least one should be new to you.

--

## Explaining Your Program to Your Counselor

Be ready to answer these questions for each project:

- What **input** does your program take?
- What **decisions** does it make? (if/else, loops, comparisons)
- What **output** does it produce?
- What **bugs** did you find, and how did you fix them?
- What would you add or improve if you had more time?

> Talking through your own code is a real professional skill — developers do "code reviews" every day.

---

## Requirement 6
# 🎯 Careers

**Choose ONE of the following:**

--

## Option A — Research a Programming Career

Pick **one career** in programming and investigate:

- What **education or training** is required?
- What are the **costs** to get qualified (school, bootcamp, self-study)?
- What are the **job prospects** — demand, growth outlook?
- What is the typical **salary range** in your area?
- What are the **day-to-day duties**?
- What does **career advancement** look like?

Then discuss your findings with your counselor.

Note: Good careers to research: software engineer, web developer, game developer, data scientist, DevOps engineer, embedded systems programmer, mobile developer.

--

## Option B — Programming as a Hobby or Healthy Lifestyle

How could programming support something you already love?

**Real examples:**
- Automate stats tracking for a sport you play
- Build tools for a creative hobby — music, art, writing
- Create fitness or habit tracking apps
- Program robots, drones, or smart home devices for fun
- Make mods for games you already play

--

## Option B (continued)

**Research:**
- Training resources available (free and paid)
- Typical expenses (hardware, software, classes)
- Organizations and communities you could join

**Then discuss with your counselor:**
- What **short-term goals** could you achieve in the next 6-12 months?
- What **long-term goals** might this hobby lead to in 3-5 years?

Note: This option is great for scouts who aren't targeting a tech career but want to apply programming to their passions.
